\noindent This latex project is a doctoral thesis template for Faculty of Social Science (FOSS), The University of Hong Kong.

With the reference to the repo of \href{https://github.com/monaen/HKU-Thesis-Template/tree/master}{\textbf{monaen/HKU-Thesis-Template}}, the style and design of the entire project closely follow the official guidelines from the Graduate School: \href{https://calendar.hku.hk/regulations-governing-the-format-binding-and-presentation-of-theses-for-higher-degrees-by-research/}{\textbf{Regulations Governing the Format, Binding and Presentation of Theses for Higher Degrees by Research}}, we have made some revisons to the LaTex template to meet the requirements of FOSS. 

In addition to the opening of abstract, the abstract \uline{should appear before the title page}. The abstract in this template is \uline{not numbered, or counted in the pagination of the front matter, or listed in the table of contents}.

Even though the template is prepared strictly follow the stipulations of the Graduate School of The University of Hong Kong, this is \textbf{not an official} template and we are \textbf{not responsible} for any problems of your thesis submission caused by the format, style, typeset, etc of the template. We \textbf{strongly suggest} the users to read the latest \textbf{Guidelines on Thesis Submission} carefully and adjust the template accordingly to satisfy the stipulations of the university.
